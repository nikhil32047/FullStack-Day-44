Day 44:
==========

a) Working with csv Module
====================================
The csv module is used to read from and write to CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.
CSV files are widely used for data exchange between applications like Excel and databases.

Before using, import the module:

import csv


CSV files are usually opened with:

r → read

w → write

newline='' (recommended)

Example:

import csv

with open("data.csv", "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])


Key Points:

Lightweight and fast

No external libraries required

Handles tabular data easily


b) Submodules / Functions of CSV:
=======================================
writer()

Creates a writer object to write data into a CSV file.

writer = csv.writer(f)

writerow()

Writes one row at a time.

writer.writerow(["Nikhil", 22])

reader()

Reads CSV file line by line.

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)


Key Points:

writerow() writes lists/tuples

reader() returns each row as a list
